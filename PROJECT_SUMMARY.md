# Budget Management System - Project Summary

## Overview

This is a complete Django + Celery Budget Management System for advertising campaigns. The system tracks daily and monthly ad spend, automatically manages campaign activation/deactivation based on budgets, and enforces dayparting schedules.

## Key Features Implemented

### ✅ Core Requirements
- **Budget Tracking**: Daily and monthly spend tracking for brands and campaigns
- **Campaign Management**: Automatic activation/deactivation based on budget limits
- **Dayparting**: Campaign scheduling with specific time windows and days
- **Automated Resets**: Daily and monthly budget resets with campaign reactivation
- **Static Typing**: Full type hints throughout the codebase with MyPy support

### ✅ Technical Implementation
- **Django Models**: Complete ORM with relationships and business logic
- **Celery Tasks**: Background processing for spend updates and budget enforcement
- **Admin Interface**: Rich Django admin with color-coded budget displays
- **REST API**: Full API endpoints for all operations
- **Management Commands**: CLI tools for budget resets and status checks

## Data Models

### Brand
- Represents advertising brands/clients
- Has daily and monthly budget limits
- Contains multiple campaigns
- Tracks total spend across all campaigns

### Campaign
- Belongs to a brand
- Has status (active/paused/completed/draft)
- Optional dayparting schedule
- Optional campaign-level budgets (falls back to brand budgets)
- Tracks individual campaign spend

### DaypartingSchedule
- Defines when campaigns can run
- Specifies allowed hours and days of week
- Supports overnight schedules (e.g., 22:00-06:00)
- Can be assigned to multiple campaigns

### Spend
- Tracks daily and monthly spend for campaigns
- Automatically updated by system
- Supports date-based queries and reporting

## Key Business Logic

### Budget Enforcement
- Campaigns are automatically paused when budgets are exceeded
- Both daily and monthly limits are enforced
- Campaign-level budgets take precedence over brand budgets
- System checks budgets every 5 minutes

### Dayparting Enforcement
- Campaigns are paused when outside their dayparting schedule
- Supports complex schedules (overnight, specific days)
- System checks dayparting every minute

### Budget Resets
- Daily resets at midnight (00:00)
- Monthly resets on 1st of month at midnight
- Eligible campaigns are automatically reactivated

### Campaign Activation Logic
Campaigns can only be activated if:
- Campaign status is 'active'
- Brand is active
- Brand has daily and monthly budget available
- Campaign has daily and monthly budget available
- Campaign is within dayparting schedule (if assigned)

- **reactivate_brand_campaigns_task** - Reactivate campaigns for brands
- **enforce_campaign_statuses_task** - Enforce campaign statuses
- **generate_spend_report_task** - Generate comprehensive spend reports

## Management Commands

```bash
# Reset daily budgets
python manage.py reset_daily_budgets

# Reset monthly budgets
python manage.py reset_monthly_budgets

# Check campaign statuses
python manage.py check_campaign_statuses

# Check with enforcement
python manage.py check_campaign_statuses --enforce

# Check only dayparting
python manage.py check_campaign_statuses --dayparting-only
```

## Static Typing

The entire codebase uses Python type hints (PEP 484) with MyPy support:

- All function parameters and return types are typed
- Model methods are fully typed
- Service classes use proper typing
- Celery tasks include return type annotations
- MyPy configuration ensures strict type checking

## Setup and Installation

1. **Install dependencies**: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. **Run migrations**: `python manage.py migrate`
3. **Create superuser**: `python manage.py createsuperuser`
4. **Start Redis**: `redis-server`
5. **Start Celery worker**: `celery -A budget_system worker -l info`
6. **Start Celery beat**: `celery -A budget_system beat -l info`
7. **Run server**: `python manage.py runserver`

## Testing

Run the test script to verify system functionality:
```bash
python test_system.py
```

## Type Checking

Run MyPy to check for type errors:
```bash
mypy .
```

## Admin Interface

Access the Django admin at `http://localhost:8000/admin/` to:
- Manage brands and their budgets
- Create and manage campaigns
- Set up dayparting schedules
- View spend records with color-coded budget displays

## Assumptions and Simplifications

1. **Time Zones**: All times handled in UTC
2. **Currency**: Single currency (USD) for simplicity
3. **Spend Updates**: Simulated spend tracking (would integrate with real ad platforms)
4. **Dayparting**: Basic hour-based scheduling (can be extended)
5. **Budget Types**: Daily and monthly budgets only
6. **Campaign Status**: Binary active/inactive (can be extended)

## Future Enhancements

1. **Multi-currency support**
2. **Advanced dayparting patterns**
3. **Real-time ad platform integration**
4. **Advanced reporting and analytics**
5. **Webhook notifications**
6. **Multi-tenant architecture**
7. **Advanced caching strategies**
8. **Comprehensive test suite**
